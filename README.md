# WeatherReact

Weather Web App with React, Typescript, Linter, and Prettier.

Functionality focus on advanced react, Api calls and light / dark theme.

I wanted to learn more about TypeScript since that was not part of any of my coarses.
//what did i learn?

Linter and prettier is nice when working in teams and give the code the same feel befor pushing it to git and getting conflicts.
Gives a neater and better experience.
