Weather Web App with React, Typescript, Styled components, linter, prettier, axios

The purpos of the project was to learn to write a more robust and scaleble code that catch meny of the smaller things that is featured in Javascript.

Library used:
Ract-responsive-carousel to display the weather information to the user in a slideshow where you can toggle back and forth. The package dident do exactly what i wanted so i
edited and added stuff in the package files to make it behave how i wanted it to behave and look.

react-loading-skeleton to display a grey / black loading placeholder to the user when waiting for data, i wanted to try it out since more and more companies have started to 
use it.

Key features:

Dark / lightmode is a feature that can save batteri life on the iphone and can also help readability, and with the use of Styled-component it was a very easy solve and 
with the help of React.memo() hook i prevented rerenders of the datafetching components.

Flippeble cards is a feature where user can flip a card and display more information that is located on the backside of the card. This was done from scratch with the help of
some positioning and transform(rotate)
